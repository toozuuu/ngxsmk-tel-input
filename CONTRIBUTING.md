### Development Setup

This project is an Angular workspace containing a library (`ngxsmk-tel-input`) and a demo application (`demo`).

1.  **Fork** the repository and clone it locally:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/ngxsmk-tel-input.git
    cd ngxsmk-tel-input
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build the library** to ensure the latest version is available for the demo app:
    ```bash
    ng build ngxsmk-tel-input
    ```
4.  **Run the demo application** to test your changes locally:
    ```bash
    ng serve demo
    ```
    This will serve the demo app, which consumes your local version of the library.
