# Ngxsmk Tel Input Plugin Optimizations

This document outlines the performance and code quality optimizations applied to the ngxsmk-tel-input plugin.

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Change Detection Strategy
- **Added OnPush change detection** to reduce unnecessary change detection cycles
- **Implemented proper lifecycle management** with `isDestroyed` flag to prevent operations on destroyed components

### 2. Memory Management
- **Added proper event listener cleanup** to prevent memory leaks
- **Implemented caching in service** with LRU cache for phone number parsing and validation
- **Optimized DOM manipulation** by reducing unnecessary DOM operations

### 3. Event Handling Optimizations
- **Batched zone runs** to reduce Angular change detection overhead
- **Replaced queueMicrotask with requestAnimationFrame** for better performance
- **Added proper event listener management** with cleanup tracking

### 4. Service Optimizations
- **Added intelligent caching** for parse and validation operations
- **Implemented cache size limits** to prevent memory bloat
- **Added cache clearing functionality** for memory management

### 5. CSS Performance
- **Added CSS containment** (`contain: layout style`) for better rendering performance
- **Optimized transitions** with proper easing functions
- **Added will-change properties** for GPU acceleration

## 🏗️ Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Component Structure
- **Better separation of concerns** with utility class
- **Improved error handling** with proper null checks
- **Enhanced type safety** with better TypeScript usage

### 2. Lifecycle Management
- **Proper cleanup in ngOnDestroy**
- **Prevented operations on destroyed components**
- **Better state management** with lifecycle flags

### 3. Event Management
- **Centralized event listener management**
- **Proper cleanup of event listeners**
- **Optimized event handling** with debouncing and throttling utilities

## 📦 Bundle Size Optimizations

### 1. Dynamic Imports
- **Optimized dynamic imports** for intl-tel-input
- **Reduced initial bundle size** with lazy loading

### 2. Tree Shaking
- **Better export structure** for tree shaking
- **Optimized imports** to reduce bundle size

## 🛠️ New Features

### 1. PhoneInputUtils Class
- **Debounce and throttle functions** for performance
- **DOM operation batching** for better performance
- **Viewport detection** for optimization
- **Event listener management** utilities

### 2. Enhanced Caching
- **LRU cache implementation** for phone number operations
- **Configurable cache size limits**
- **Cache clearing functionality**

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization:
- Multiple unnecessary change detection cycles
- Memory leaks from uncleaned event listeners
- Heavy DOM manipulation on every update
- No caching for repeated operations

### After Optimization:
- ✅ OnPush change detection strategy
- ✅ Proper memory management with cleanup
- ✅ Optimized DOM operations
- ✅ Intelligent caching system
- ✅ Better event handling
- ✅ CSS performance optimizations

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Using the Optimized Component
```typescript
import { NgxsmkTelInputComponent, PhoneInputUtils } from 'ngxsmk-tel-input';

@Component({
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: `
    <ngxsmk-tel-input
      [initialCountry]="'US'"
      [preferredCountries]="['US', 'GB']"
      (inputChange)="onPhoneChange($event)">
    </ngxsmk-tel-input>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  // Component logic
}
```

### Using PhoneInputUtils
```typescript
import { PhoneInputUtils } from 'ngxsmk-tel-input';

// Debounced function
const debouncedHandler = PhoneInputUtils.debounce((value: string) => {
  console.log('Debounced:', value);
}, 300);

// Throttled function
const throttledHandler = PhoneInputUtils.throttle((value: string) => {
  console.log('Throttled:', value);
}, 100);

// Batch DOM operations
PhoneInputUtils.batchDOMOperations([
  () => element1.style.display = 'none',
  () => element2.classList.add('active'),
  () => element3.textContent = 'Updated'
]);
```

## 🧪 Testing

The optimizations maintain full backward compatibility while providing significant performance improvements. All existing functionality is preserved with enhanced performance characteristics.

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
2. **Faster Rendering**: OnPush strategy and CSS optimizations
3. **Better User Experience**: Smoother interactions and animations
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Better code structure and separation of concerns
5. **Enhanced Performance**: Caching and optimized event handling
